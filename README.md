## Gamified Environmental Education Platform
---

## 🌍 Project Overview  
**EcoQuest** is an innovative **Gamified Environmental Education Platform** designed to transform how students engage with sustainability topics. Developed to address the gaps in traditional environmental education in Indian schools and colleges, EcoQuest uses interactive, game-based learning to nurture eco-friendly habits and empower youth for real-world impact.

## 🚩 Problem Description  
Despite escalating climate challenges, environmental education remains highly theoretical and textbook-centric in many institutions. Students lack engaging tools that effectively motivate them to practice sustainability or appreciate how their daily choices affect the planet.

Traditional methods fall short in inspiring action or building sustainable behaviors, resulting in a generation unprepared for ecological responsibilities.

## 🎯 Impact & Importance  
EcoQuest aims to cultivate environmentally literate future leaders by providing an interactive, hands-on learning experience aligned with India's SDG commitments and the NEP 2020 emphasis on experiential education.

By embedding real-world tasks and local involvement, EcoQuest fosters meaningful behavioral change that can ripple through families and communities, supporting long-term sustainability goals.
